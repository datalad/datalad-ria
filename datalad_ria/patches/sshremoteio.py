"""Correct flaws in `SSHRemoteIO` operation

The original code has a number of problems.

1. The ``cmd``-argument for the shell ssh-process, which is created by:
   ``self.shell = subprocess.Popen(cmd, ...)`` is not correct, if ``self.ssh``i
   is an instance of ``NoMultiplexSSHConnection``.

   The changes in this patch build the correct ``cmd``-argument by adding
   additional arguments to ``cmd``, if `self.ssh` is an instance of
   ``NoMultiplexSSHConnection``. More precisely, the arguments that are
   required to open a "shell" in a ``NoMultiplexSSHConnection`` are stored in
   ``NoMultiplexSSHConnection._ssh_open_args`` and not in
   ``NoMultiplexSSHConnection._ssh_args``. This patch therefore provides
   arguments from both lists, i.e. from ``_ssh_args`` and ``_ssh_open_args`` in
   the call that opens a "shell", if ``self.ssh`` is an instance of
   ``NoMultiplexSSHConnection``.

2. The while-loop that waits to read ``b"RIA-REMOTE-LOGIN-END\\n"`` from the
   shell ssh-process did not contain any error handling. That led to an
   infinite loop in case that the shell ssh-process terminates without writing
   ``b"RIA-REMOTE-LOGIN-END\\n"`` to its stdout, or in the case that the
   stdout-pipeline of the shell ssh-process is closed.

   This patch introduces two checks into the while loop. One check for
   termination of the ssh shell-process, and one check for a closed
   stdout-pipeline of the ssh shell-process, i.e. reading an EOF from the
   stdout-pipeline. If any of those two cases appears, an exception is raised.

3. The output endmarker handling in ``SSHRemoteIO._run()`` could not reliably
   handle commands that would yield output without a final newline (e.g.,
   ``cat`` of a file without a trailing newline). This patch changes to
   endmarker handling to guarantee that they appear on a dedicated line,
   by prefixing the marker itself with a newline (which is withheld form the
   actual output).

In addition, this patch modifies two comments. It adds a missing description of
the ``buffer_size``-parameter of ``SSHRemoteIO.__init__``to the doc-string, and
fixes the description of the condition in the comment on the use of
``DEFAULT_BUFFER_SIZE``.
