"""Enable SSH-based remote command execution on Windows

This change introduces a replacement for core's
``datalad/support/sshconnector.py:BaseSSHConnection._exec_ssh()``
with a dedicated handling of ``stdin`` for Windows.

Without this change, the first remote command execution would succeed,
but upon exit the Python session would somehow "loose" its own ``stdin``
file descriptor.

This change passes an explicit, empty, byte-string as ``stdin`` to the
SSH client call, in order to avoid any interaction of SSH with the
parent process's ``stdin`` descriptor.
